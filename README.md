Boosting improves machine models' predictive accuracy and performance by converting multiple weak
learners into a single strong learning model. Machine learning models can be weak learners or strong
learners .
Weak learners have low prediction accuracy, similar to random guessing. They are prone to
overfittingâ€”that is, they can't classify data that varies too much from their original dataset. 
Strong learners have higher prediction accuracy. Boosting converts a system of weak learners
into a single strong learning system. 
scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is an open-sourced Python library and includes a variety of unsupervised and
supervised learning techniques. It is based on libraries like Matplotlib, Pandas an
